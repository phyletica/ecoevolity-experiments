    Assessing the affect of missing data on the
    the accuracy and precision of divergence time estimates (in units of
    expected subsitutions per site).
    The columns, from left to right, show the results when each simulated
    500,000-character matrix has approximately 0\%, 10\%, 25\%, and 50\%
    missing cells.
    The rows show the results when (top) all sites and (bottom) only variable
    sites are analyzed.
