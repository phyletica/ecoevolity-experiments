    Assessing the affect of linked sites on the ability of the new method to
    estimate the number of divergence events.
    The columns, from left to right, show the results when loci are simulated
    with 100, 500, and 1000 linked sites.
    For each simulated \dataset, each of three population pairs has
    500,000 sites total.
    The rows show the results when (top) all sites, (middle) all variable
    sites, and (bottom) at most one variable site per locus are analyzed.
