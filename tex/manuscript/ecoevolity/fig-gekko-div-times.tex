    The approximate marginal posterior densities of divergence times for each
    \spp{Gekko} pair of populations,
    under eight different combinations of prior on the divergence times (rows)
    and the concentration parameter of the Dirichlet process (columns).
    For these analyses, constant characters were included, and all characters
    with more than two alleles were recoded as biallelic.
