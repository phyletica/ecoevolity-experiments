    Assessing frequentist behavior of divergence-model posterior probabilities
    when there is no model misspecification.
    20,500 \datasets were simulated and analyzed under the same model and
    assigned to bins of width 0.2 based on the estimated posterior
    probability of a single, shared divergence event.
    The mean posterior probability of each bin is plotted agains the proportion
    of \datasets in the bin for which a single, shared divergence is the
    true model.
    The number of \datasets within each bin is provided next to the
    corresponding plotted point.
    The left plot shows the results when all characters are analyzed, and the
    right plot shows the results when only the variable characters are
    analyzed.
    All simulated \datasets had three pairs of populations, each with 100,000
    characters.
