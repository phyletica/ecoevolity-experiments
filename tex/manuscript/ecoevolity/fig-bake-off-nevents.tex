    Comparing the ability to estimate the number of divergence events between
    (left) the new full-likelihood Bayesian method, \ecoevolity, and (right)
    the approximate-likelihood Bayesian method, \dppmsbayes.
    Each plot shows the results of the analyses of 500 simulated \datasets;
    the number of \datasets that fall within each possible cell
    of true versus estimated numbers of events is shown, and cells with
    more \datasets are shaded darker.
    Each simulated \dataset contained three pairs of populations, and the
    simulated character matrix for each pair consisted of 200 loci, each with
    200 linked sites (40,000 characters total).
