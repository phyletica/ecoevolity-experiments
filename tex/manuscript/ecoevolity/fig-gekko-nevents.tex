    The prior (light bars) and approximated posterior (dark bars) probabilities
    of the number of divergence events across \spp{Gekko} pairs of populations,
    under eight different combinations of prior on the divergence times (rows)
    and the concentration parameter of the Dirichlet process (columns).
    For these analyses, constant characters were included, and all characters
    with more than two alleles were recoded as biallelic.
    The Bayes factor for each number of divergence times is given above the
    corresponding bars.
    Each Bayes factor compares the corresponding number of events 
    to all other possible numbers of divergence events.
