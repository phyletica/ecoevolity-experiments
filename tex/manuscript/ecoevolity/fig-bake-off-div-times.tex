    Comparing the accuracy and precision of divergence-time estimates between
    (left) the new full-likelihood Bayesian method, \ecoevolity, and (right)
    the approximate-likelihood Bayesian method, \dppmsbayes.
    Each plotted circle and associated error bars represent the posterior mean
    and 95\% credible interval for the time that a pair of populations
    diverged.
    Each plot consists of 1500 estimates---500 simulated \datasets, each with
    three pairs of populations.
    The simulated character matrix for each population pair consisted of 200 loci,
    each with 200 linked sites (40,000 characters total).
