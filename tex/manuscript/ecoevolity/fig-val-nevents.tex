    The ability of the new method to estimate the number of divergence events
    when data are simulated and analyzed
    under the same model
    (i.e., no model misspecification).
    \validationfiguregriddescription
    Each plot shows the results of the analyses of 500 simulated \datasets,
    each with three population pairs;
    the number of \datasets that fall within each possible cell
    of true versus estimated numbers of events is shown, and cells with
    more \datasets are shaded darker.
