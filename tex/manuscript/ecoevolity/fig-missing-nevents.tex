    Assessing the affect of missing data on the ability of the new method to
    estimate the number of divergence events.
    The columns, from left to right, show the results when each simulated
    500,000-character matrix has approximately 0\%, 10\%, 25\%, and 50\%
    missing cells.
    The rows show the results when (top) all sites and (bottom) only variable
    sites are analyzed.
