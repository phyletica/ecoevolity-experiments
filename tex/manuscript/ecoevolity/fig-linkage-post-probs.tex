    Assessing the affect of linked sites on the frequentist behavior of
    divergence-model posterior probabilities.
    10,500 \datasets were simulated such that each of three population pairs
    has 1000 loci, each with 100 linked sites (100,000 sites total).
    Each simulated \dataset is assigned to a bin of width 0.2 based on the
    estimated posterior probability of a single, shared divergence event.
    The mean posterior probability of each bin is plotted against the
    proportion of \datasets in the bin for which a single, shared divergence is
    the true model.
    The number of \datasets within each bin is provided next to the
    corresponding plotted point.
    The plots show the results when (left) all characters, (middle) all
    variable characters, and (right) at most one variable character per locus
    is analyzed.
