    Assessing the affect of an acquisition bias against rare allele patterns on
    the accuracy and precision of divergence time estimates (in units of
    expected subsitutions per site).
    The columns, from left to right, show the results when each simulated
    500,000-character \dataset has a probability of 100\%, 80\%, 60\%, and 40\%
    of sampling each simulated singleton pattern.
    E.g., each character matrix analyzed in the far right column is missing
    approximately 60\% of characters where all but one gene copy has the same
    allele.
    The rows show the results when (top) all sites and (bottom) only variable
    sites are analyzed.
