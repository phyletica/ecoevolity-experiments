# Notes on chain convergence for Gekko analyses

Nearly all chains converged almost immediately (well before 100 samples).

Three chains took a little over 100 samples to converge:
-   run-6-gekko-conc044-rate005-nopoly-state-run-1.log
-   run-7-gekko-conc377-rate005-state-run-1.log
-   run-5-gekko-conc377-rate005-nopoly-state-run-1.log
